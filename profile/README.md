**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Welcome to the Forus Community 👋

Forus is a brazillian social network developed by students. Since then, the Forus Community has been created to make open source libraries available through GitHub. We want to create a large community that can help Forus grow and also make tutorials, templates and source codes available for free to use in any other projects.

## Visit the Forus website and download the app!



## Get involved!

You can join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rsJJ3dqF7D). Everyone is welcome!
